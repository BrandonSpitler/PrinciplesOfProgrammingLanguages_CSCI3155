a.)The use of pi at line 4 is bound at line 3

The use of pi at line 7 is bound at line 1

b.) The use of x in line 3 is bound at line 2

The use of x in line 6 is bound at line 5

The use of x on line 10 is bound at line 5

The use of x on line 13 is bound at 1




c.) ( (Int,Int),Int)

This was determined by the know fact that b=(x,3) and a=1 so the two returns are ((x,3),1) and ((x,3),a+2) where a and b are both ints

formal arguement:

	(b,1):((Int,Int),Int) because

		b:(x,3):(int,int)because

			x:Int

			3:Int

		1:Int
